# TODO

* Get tests to pass on 2.7 
  * something seems to be wrong with the pickling 
    there's a flag you should set
  * You don't really need to worry about being on 3.5
    The ledger library can only be invoked with `ledger python ...`
    so you'll need to write that python as a stand alone script.
    what a PITA.
* Figure out how to export ledger transactions in a reliable and readable format
