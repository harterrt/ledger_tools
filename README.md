# Ledger Tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harterrt/ledger_tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harterrt/ledger_tools)

This is a suite of tools to make it easier to work with [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) files.
This repo is currently only meant for personal use, so the documentation is lacking.
